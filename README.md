[**Description of this repository**]<br>
This is a repo with sample Business Intelligence and Data Visualization projects using Power BI and fictitious data sets.

[**Content and Run**]<br>
The main content of this repository are the Power BI dashboards, contained at the .pbix files. A BI Dashboard is a dynamic interactive panel, populated with BI pre-treated data, aimed at showing some data-driven business analysis to the user. Such visualization of data analyses is performed as a storytelling, based on useful and meaningful analytical scenarios (for each company), in order to support in-company strategic decision-making. You can run these panels by simply having Microsoft Power BI installed at your local machine and opening the .pbix files (after cloning this repo locally). All dependencies (data sets) are at the remote root path of this repository, pointed out by each .pbix project already. 

If it is the first time you refer to GitHub paths from your Power BI installation, and at the Power Query (Transform Data ETL) section a warning box appears asking you how to acess the remote data, just click on it and choose to connect anonymously - all data in this repo is public, no need for authentications. If you still can't load the data, after refreshing the tables, just reset the "source" parameter, according to your filesystem, pointing out the data locally, at this repo root folder at your machine.

Microsoft Power BI for Desktop, unfortunately, is a proprietary BI software. It has a free version but only works on Windows - no open-source versions available for Linux or Mac. Therefore, if you use another operating system, as me, and would like to try Power BI, you could firstly install Oracle VM VirtualBox (a virtual machine manager), create a Windows virtual machine with it and then install Power BI Desktop on it. Do not forget to install the Guest Additions extra package, so that you can set the maximum resolution of your screen at your Windows virtual machine (1K or 4k)... instead of leaving the low resolution that is set by default at VirtualBox. You can read more about it at VirtualBox documentation.
