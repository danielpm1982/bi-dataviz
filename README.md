[**Description of this repository**]<br>
This is a repo with sample Business Intelligence and Data Visualization projects using Power BI and fictitious data sets.

[**Content and Run**]<br>
The main content of this repository are the Power BI dashboards, contained at the .pbix files. A BI Dashboard is a dynamic interactive panel, populated with BI pre-treated data, aimed at showing some data analysis to the user. Such visualization of data analyses is performed as a storytelling, based on useful and meaningful business scenarios (for each company), in order to support in-company strategic decision-making. You can run these panels by simply having Microsoft Power BI installed at your local machine and opening the .pbix files (after cloning this repo locally). All dependencies (data sets) are at the remote root path of this repository, pointed out by each .pbix project already.
